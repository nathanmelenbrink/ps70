- <b>Saw Station:</b> Use a [hand saw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5YmVHB3P5I), use the [scroll saw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_fenDdm4oQ). Use [hand files](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4KaiG7CpSQ) and the [bench grinder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvW4MVvk69A). 
- <b>Drill Station:</b> Use a [hand drill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6qzo3LYTR4), use the [drill press](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nu9tYcld7ck), and [tap a hole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWCQ-hlQvdY).
- <b>Assembly Station:</b> 
	- Measure something using micrometer, calipers, protractor, and level.
	- Joining: [nuts & bolts](https://youtu.be/zIGz8STM-fI), [screws](https://youtu.be/5cA9bZRHpZE), nails, and glue. 
	- Experiment with gears, bearings, belts, pulleys.

### Labs:

Split into two or more teams and work on building automata. 
<a href='../../lab/tools/automata_kit.html' target="_self">Instructions Here</a><br>

- Compete to be the fastest team to assemble each of the mechanical components
- Try connecting a motor to the mechanisms 
- Try combining motion primitives into more complex motions (this may also help you conceptualize your kinetic sculpture assignment)
- Fusion model a motor mount and coupling, <a href='../../lab/cutting/PS70MotorMountandCouplingTutorial.pdf' >PDF follow along</a>
If there's time left, work on kinetic sculpture assignment. 

### Assignment: 

<ul>
<li>Create a kinetic sculpture. Include circuitry (i.e., a motor and a power source) to move your sculpture. </li>
<!-- <li>Control the sculpture with a circuit on a breadboard that uses components in the lab (e.g., resistors, potentiometer). Use a multimeter to measure the voltages in your circuit.  Use Ohm's law to calculate current through the circuit. </li> -->
<!-- <li>Use the Microcontroller Analog in (ADC) to measure the voltage of a potentiometer, or other voltage-divider-based sensor.</li>
<li>(Optional) Use tools like TinkerCAD to simulate your circuit and/or tools like Fusion 360 to design and simulate your mechanism.</li> -->
<li> Document your work and learning. Use the photo booth in the lab to record a video of your sculpture and <a href='../../lab/website/video.html' target="_self">include at least one video/gif</a> in your documentation. </li>

</ul>

### Resources:

<a href='https://motiongen.io/'>MotionGen</a> is one of many online tools for designing and animating mechanisms. (Though it may be a better use of time to do this in Fusion with joints and motion studies). <br> 
Modeling gears in Fusion360 from scratch is a useful exercise. But you can also use a script to help automate the process. (Find the Utilities tab, click the "ADD-INS" drop-down, and select "Scripts and Add-ins". Select the "Spur Gear" script, and adjust the parameters to get the gear you want.) If you need bevel gears, rack and pinions, or other more sophisticated gears, you might want to try installing the <a href='https://apps.autodesk.com/FUSION/en/Detail/Index?id=1236778940008086660&appLang=en&os=Win64'>Gear Generator plugin</a>. <br>
Look up artists like <a href='https://www.youtube.com/user/dreamingmachines/videos' >Arthur Ganson </a> and <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_22x26qYPA' >others</a>. These pieces probably took more than a few days to complete, but likely many of them started with study models made from things like cardboard and simple DC motors. <br>
Here is a fun old reference for mechanisms: <a href='http://507movements.com/' > 507 Mechanical Movements</a>, and <a href='https://www.fivehundredseven.com/'>offshoots</a>. <br>
