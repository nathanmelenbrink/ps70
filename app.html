		<h3> Course Applications (Fall '22)</h3>


		<p>PS70: This introductory course covers a range of fabrication skills targeted to beginners. Students are introduced to popular cutting-edge microcontrollers as opposed to making them from scratch, allowing for more time to be dedicated to sensor design and fabrication, programming, and skill integration for final projects. </p>


		<p> MIT MAS 863: How to Make (Almost) Anything

This intensive course covers a range of skills from the ground up including electronics design, programming, and 3D design, with an emphasis on designing and fabricating circuitboards. The Makerspace has supported Harvard students' participation in this course since 2013.  

		If you'd like to learn more, please visit our open house on 8/24. 

PS70 has an enrollment cap of 15 students, and applications are due 8/24 (the registration deadline is 8/26). HTMAA has an enrollment cap of 15 for the Harvard section, 

This means that if you're applying to HTMAA, you should arrange a backup course in case you are not admitted. You may apply to PS70 as a backup. We will maintain a waitlist while 
Students on the waitlist are encouraged to join class activities.
