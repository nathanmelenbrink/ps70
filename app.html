		<h3> Course Applications (Fall '22)</h3>


		<p> <b>MIT MAS 863: How to Make (Almost) Anything: </b>(Fall) This intensive graduate-level course covers a range of skills from the ground up including electronics design, programming, and 3D design, with an emphasis on electronics design and fabricating circuitboards. The course consists lectures 1-4pm Wednesdays (MIT), training sessions 10-11am Thursdays (Science Center), optional recitations 5-6pm Thursdays (MIT), informal ad hoc workshops, and self-guided learning in the Science Center Fabrication Lab. </p>

		<p> <b>PS70: Introduction to Digital Fabrication: </b>(Fall/Spring) This introductory course covers a range of fabrication skills targeted to beginners. Students are introduced to popular new microcontrollers as opposed to making them from scratch, allowing for more time to be dedicated to sensor design and fabrication, programming, and skill integration for final projects. Course meetings consist primarily of guided hands-on workshops with minimal lecture content, in addition to weekly lab sessions, informal ad hoc workshops, and self-guided learning in the Science Center Fabrication Lab. </p>

		<p>Generally, we recommend HTMAA to folks with prior experience in either programming, electronics design, or 3D design and digital fabrication. On the other hand, PS70 is suitable for students of all skill levels. If you'd like to learn more, please visit our <b>open house on 8/24, from 4-6pm in SC 102!</b>, or join us <a href='https://harvard.zoom.us/my/melenbrink'>on zoom</a>. </p>

		<h3>Waitlist</h3>

		<p>PS70 has an enrollment cap of 15 students, and <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd5NfvJBcjNiQoaGDW2io12W1BX7VzB2_3cie9P1O8eUxjLdw/viewform">applications</a> are due 8/24 (Harvard's registration deadline is 8/26). </p>

		<p>HTMAA has an enrollment cap of 15 for the Harvard section. <a href='http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.21/file/preapp.html'>Applications</a> are due after the first class on Wed, Sept 7th, and acceptance will not be announced until the 11th. This means that if you're applying to HTMAA, you should arrange a backup course in case you are not admitted. You may apply to PS70 as a backup (the application processes are brief and nearly identical, so there's no extra work). We will maintain a waitlist for PS70 until HTMAA students are selected. Students are encouraged to join class activities while on the waitlist. </p>
