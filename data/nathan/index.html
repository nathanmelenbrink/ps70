### Nathan Melenbrink

### VaultBot

 - Networked simple machine for [spring 2020]( https://roberthart56.github.io/SCFAB/SC_lab/PS70_machine/index_rev1.html) and [summer 2020](https://roberthart56.github.io/SCFAB/SC_lab/S-12machine/index.html) intro fab classes.

 - Notes on building the [Ender](https://gitlab.cba.mit.edu/classes/865.21/site/-/tree/master/people/robhart/ender3)3D printer, and [Genmitsu](https://gitlab.cba.mit.edu/classes/865.21/site/-/tree/master/people/robhart/genmitsu) mini CNC.

  

 
 - Projects with [plastic recycling machines.](https://preciousplastic.com/)
 - Use 3D printer as PCB mill?  Tool change could be easy with the Ender-3.
 - [Musical instrument keyboard simulation](./keyboard/index.html)
 
### HTMAA 2014

- I spent time in HTMAA exploring drawing with machines. I made a cable-actuated wall plotter for my final project.
