### VaultBot

Most recently, I made a machine that builds vaults from identical blocks. The idea is that in a scaled-up version the blocks could be filled with regolith and used to assemble radiation shields to protect extraterrestrial habitats. Other people have proposed additive manufacturing with regolith for this purpose. I think this method of essentially converting the regolith into a discrete material could be more tractable, as additive manufacturing is dependent on the physical and chemical properties of regolith (which vary considerably). 

Previous work (from multiple labs) has demonstrated impressive discrete assembly robots, but (to my knowledge) none that were able to build spanning structures that support the weight of the robot.

### HTMAA 2014

I spent time in HTMAA exploring drawing with machines. I made a cable-actuated wall plotter for my final project.

I also wrote some gcode generators to make big paintings on the Shopbot.

### Architecture

I worked as an architect and facade specialist between 2008-2014 mostly in Shanghai, China.
