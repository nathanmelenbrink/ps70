## Nathan Melenbrink

### VaultBot

 - Networked simple machine for [spring 2020]( https://roberthart56.github.io/SCFAB/SC_lab/PS70_machine/index_rev1.html) and [summer 2020](https://roberthart56.github.io/SCFAB/SC_lab/S-12machine/index.html) intro fab classes.

 - Notes on building the [Ender](https://gitlab.cba.mit.edu/classes/865.21/site/-/tree/master/people/robhart/ender3)3D printer, and [Genmitsu](https://gitlab.cba.mit.edu/classes/865.21/site/-/tree/master/people/robhart/genmitsu) mini CNC.

### Projects for this term.

Machines are central to what I would like to do and teach in fablabs.  First, PCB making is one of the most important superpowers that the fablab enables, and it should be easy for beginners to do successfully, and simple to set up in any lab.  The ability to setup and reconfigure machines to do creative things is very important (think Nadya's Fab Academy 2015).  This should work well, and both software and hardware should be accessible to beginners.  This spring, I'm working at home, and developing tools and capabilities with resources similar to a small fab lab.


 - Simple [PCB machine](./simple_pcb/index.html) that can be made with limited tooling.  Explore methods for simple and precise mechanisms:

  - Cams, Sliding elements, Flexures
  - Spindles, or other actuators.
  - Control software/firmware.

 - Vinyl cutter.  I have a small vinylcutter that I'd like to control with my own boards and software.

 - Projects with [plastic recycling machines.](https://preciousplastic.com/)
 - Use 3D printer as PCB mill?  Tool change could be easy with the Ender-3.
 - [Musical instrument keyboard simulation](./keyboard/index.html)
 
### Goals and capabilities

 - Get [clank](./clank/index.html) running, understand its control, evaluate it.
 - Learn how to use the A4950 in greater detail.  Make fabbable driver boards.
 - Learn how to make a simple, reconfigurable, beginner-friendly networked machine.
