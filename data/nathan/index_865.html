### VaultBot

Most recently, I made a machine that builds vaults from identical blocks. The idea is that in a scaled-up version the blocks could be filled with regolith and used to assemble radiation shields to protect extraterrestrial habitats. Other people have proposed additive manufacturing with regolith for this purpose. I think this method of essentially converting the regolith into a discrete material could be more tractable, as additive manufacturing is dependent on the physical and chemical properties of regolith (which vary considerably). 

Previous work (from multiple labs) has demonstrated impressive discrete assembly robots, but (to my knowledge) none that were able to build spanning structures that support the weight of the robot.

I am also interested in instrumenting discrete building blocks with capacitive sensors to provide force feedback during assembly.

### Pile Driving 

Useful structures in the built environment are not constructed with discrete materials alone. Rather than resting atop the ground, they must be anchored to it. This seemed to be overlooked, so I made a robot to perform simple anchoring tasks.

### HTMAA 2014

I spent time in HTMAA exploring drawing with machines. I made a cable-actuated wall plotter for my final project.

I also wrote some gcode generators to make big paintings on the Shopbot.

### Architecture

I worked as an architect and facade specialist between 2008-2014 mostly in Shanghai, China.

### HTMSTMAA

There is interest in developing methods for in-situ aluminum recycling. Powderized aluminum (or other metals) can be deposited on a bed along with a higher melting-temperature material (e.g. sand) to act as a mold. 


However, I am unaware of any DIY-able techniques for powderizing aluminum. I'm wondering if instead scrap aluminum could be chopped up into ~1cm (or smaller) voxels. Those voxels would then be arranged on a tray and the mold material would be poured around it. Then the tray would be baked in a lab furnace. 

I am also teaching an intro course on digital fabrication, for which I prepared fab-at-home kits for each student (much credit to [Rob Hart](https://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/865.21/people/robhart/) who used to co-teach the course and helped with kits).

This semester, since students unfortunately won't be able to use the laser cutter directly, I have included a 12x12" plywood laser-cut sheet inspired by some of the budget machine-building approaches I've seen especially from Nadya and Jake. The parts can be punched out and combined with simple 3D printed parts in the kit to make, e.g., an H-Bot drawing machine, or two linear stages. It's no Clank, but it works better than I'd expected.
