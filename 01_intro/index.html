		<h3> Tuesday: </h3>
		<p>
			3:00: Welcome: <a href='./why.html'>Why learn digital fabrication? </a><br>
			3:15: Introductions, <a href='./overview.html'>Course Overview</a>, <a href='../about.html'>Syllabus</a> <br> 
			3:45: <a href='./github.html'>GitHub, GH Pages</a> <br>
		</p>

 		<p> We'll need some software for today. Please download and install a text editor if you don't have one already (e.g., <a href ="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>). Everyone will also need to make a <a href ="http://github.com">GitHub account</a>. You'll also need to download the <a href ="https://desktop.github.com/">GitHub Desktop</a> application, open it, and link it to your account. </p>
 			
 		<p> For next class, you'll need to install the <a href='https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software'>Arduino IDE</a><!-- as well as the <a href='https://learn.adafruit.com/add-boards-arduino-v164/setup'>Adafruit SAMD Boards</a> -->. You'll also need to create a <a href='https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/students-teachers-educators'>Fusion 360 </a>account, and download that software as well. </p>

 		<h3> Thursday: </h3>
		<p>
			3:00: <a href='./htmlcss.html'>HTML, CSS</a>, <a href='./video.html'>Images and Video in HTML</a><br>
			3:45: Breakout rooms for final project brainstorm <br> 
			4:00: Final project discussion <br>
			</a> 
		</p>

		<h3> Readings:</h3> 
		<p> Read Chapters 1-3 of <a href='http://mars1980.github.io/resources/making_things_move.pdf' >Making Things Move</a>. Make a note of some of the more interesting points you learn. </p>

		<h3> Labs:</h3> 
		<p> Help with GitHub, GH Pages, HTML and CSS. Discuss final project ideas. </p>
 	
		<h3> Assignment:</h3> 
	 		<p> Create a website and make a page with a proposal for a possible final project. Download and install the software listed above. 
			<!-- Using a breadboard, build a simple circuit and learn something about it.  Measure voltages using a digital multi-meter. Document this on your page for "Week 1". --> </p>
 		<p>
			You will use this website to document your work for the rest of the semester. You are welcome to use any tools you'd like to accomplish this, but if you don't have any previous web development experience, you may want to stick with one of the templates. If you're new to writing HTML, you may find it helpful to start with an online HTML converter. You're encouraged to use the HTML and CSS techniques we covered in class to cutomize your site -- even better if you research new techniques and make a novel website. You can also continue to update your website styling/layout for the rest of the semester.
			The goal for this week is to make the site functional, i.e., that you're able to use it to host your assignments in a way that others are able to find them. Please make sure your website is up and running, including your final project idea by Thursday.
		</p>

		<p>
			 Your website should include:
			 <ul>
			 	<li> An index.html page that contains links to each assignment page </li>
		 		<li> An "About" page, including a short paragraph about yourself </li>
				<li> Some customization using HTML and CSS </li>
				<li> A final project proposal </li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p>
			Feel free to discuss final project ideas with the teaching staff and with each other. The projects we showed at the beginning of class might give you an idea of the range of possibilities. It's okay to propose something ambitious; the teaching staff will work with you to scale your idea to a tractable amount of work for the course. Take a look through all of the topics we'll cover. Final projects should integrate most of the skills covered over the semester, including at a minimum:

			<ul>
				<li> 3D design and fabrication (either mold/cast, 3D print, lasercut, etc.)</li>
				<li> Electronics (input and output)</li>
				<li> Microcontroller programming</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
