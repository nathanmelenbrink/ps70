	<div class="col-md-9">

	<h3> Scope and expectations </h3>
	<p> 
		<ul>
			<li> Many skill areas - broad and quick. </li>
			<li> We intend for this course to be accessible to beginners as well as worthwhile for more advanced makers.  </li>
			<li> Each week is intended to let you get hands on and start an exploration.</li> 
			<li> After each week, you will know how to do something safely and correctly, and will have documented it.  You will also identify resources for going further.  This will give you what you need to return and learn more deeply later. </li>
			<li> The final project is intended to show you how to integrate multiple capabilities.  These topics add up in surprising ways.  We will encourage you to build simple modular prototypes on the way to a final project.  The result is not likely to be a finished product. </li>
	</ul></p>

	
	<h3> Grading </h3>
	<p> Grade is based on your documentation of learning, not on how much or what you learned.
		<ul>
			<li> Weekly documentation: 60%</li>
			<li> Final project and its documentation: 20%  </li>
			<li> Participation (important due to safety concerns): 20% </li>
	</ul></p>


	<h3> Weekly pattern </h3>
	<p> Tuesdays in class: 
		<ul>
			<li> Website review and discussion of work from prior week.  This should be the most intellectually nutritive part of the class, and is up to you to generate.</li>
			<li> Preparation for new topic. </li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p> Thursdays in class: 
		<ul>
			<li> Lecture and demonstrations for new topic.</li>
			<li> Hands-on training on new topic. </li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p> Thursdays - Tuesday: 
		<ul>
			<li> Supplemental workshops.</li>
			<li> Scheduled lab help times. </li>
			<li> Lab access.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<h3> Assignments </h3>
	<p> 
		<ul>
			<li> Common tasks.</li>
			<li> Individual explorations. </li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<h3> Resources </h3>
	<p> 
		<ul>
			<li> Course website and links therin.</li>
			<li> <a href=' ' >HTMAA course website and student pages.</a> </li>
			<li> <a href=' ' >Summer school website and student pages.</a> </li>
			<li> <a href=' ' >fab.physics.harvard.edu - links to Lab Github pages.</a> </li>
			<li>Members of this class, Nathan, Victoria, Rob, and others in the lab. </li>
			<li>Tutorials and other internet documentation of high quality - we will all be involved in curating these resources. </li>
			<li>Books, on paper and online. </li>
