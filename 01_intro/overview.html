	<h3> Scope and expectations </h3>
	<p> 
		<ul>
			<li> Many skill areas - broad and quick. </li>
			<li> We intend for this course to be accessible to beginners as well as worthwhile for more advanced makers.  </li>
			<li> Each week is intended to let you get hands on and start an exploration.</li> 
			<li> After each week, you will know how to do something safely and correctly, and will have documented it. You will also identify resources for going further. This will give you what you need to return and learn more deeply later. </li>
			<li> The final project is intended to show you how to integrate multiple capabilities. These topics add up in surprising ways. We will encourage you to build simple modular prototypes on the way to a final project. The result is not likely to be a finished product. </li>
	</ul></p>

	
	<h3> Grading </h3>
	<p> Grade is based on your documentation of learning, not on how much or what you learned.
		<ul>
			<li> Weekly documentation: 60%</li>
			<li> Final project and its documentation: 20%  </li>
			<li> Participation (important due to safety concerns): 20% </li>
	</ul></p>

<!-- Building Community:

One of the clear takeaways from student feedback for the Summer 2020 PHYS S-12 course was that the teaching team should be more proactive in fostering peer-to-peer interactions in the remote format. The Spring 2020 course had the advantage of students making in-person connections before the semester went remote. For Spring 2021 we do not assume to have this advantage, and propose to compensate by fostering a sense of community in the course in the following ways: 

Slack Workspace: A Slack workspace was initiated upon student request during the hectic transition of March 2020. Students found it to be a productive resource for seeking help with their assignments, where they could engage with course staff as well as their peers. We created channels specific to electronics, programming and 3D design in addition to special topical channels for e.g. DIY PPE for pandemic response. The workspace was rebranded as the “Virtual Makerspace (Room 102)” upon the completion of the semester, allowing the Spring students to stay connected and follow along with Summer final projects. We have since included additional members of our community (staff and former students). Summer students were excited to be able to join the Slack before the course began (almost all wrote to introduce themselves), and also made frequent use of the workspace throughout the semester. The use of Slack has been consistently praised in student feedback (for both Spring and Summer courses). 
For remote debugging of circuits, we’ve found the most effective way is to ask students to take a photograph of their circuit and upload it via the Slack app (as opposed to holding their breadboard in front of their webcam, which is shaky and loses focus). 

Group projects: a straightforward way to foster more peer interaction is to replace individual assignments with group/pair assignments where possible. (Final projects should still be individual, as the course focus on skill synthesis requires that all students independently demonstrate the full range of their skill development.) In particular, the assignment related to wireless networking (Internet of Things) will be made into a pair assignment, where students should demonstrate remote operation of each other’s devices using a serverless database. Furthermore, the first assignment (which requires students to use GitHub to build a website), will be modified to require students to use the collaborative features of the platform. 

Breakout rooms: The course will make greater use of breakout rooms (regardless of remote or hybrid format) to foster peer interactions. Compared to the Spring 2020 course, the Summer 2020 course already featured additional use of breakout rooms for hands-on remote learning, which students praised as an effective method for conducting workshops. We will also assign short exercises at the beginning of Thursday classes (such as debugging an Arduino program or calibrating a voltage divider circuit to a specific range) to be completed in pairs. We will encourage students to keep a tablet or smartphone handy for sharing images or video of their projects in real-time (either over Zoom or Slack). 
The beginning of Tuesday classes is reserved for students to share their previous assignments, which so far has been conducted with the entire class. The usefulness of this format varies by week and received mixed reviews from the students. For Spring 2021, students will instead share their work in small breakout rooms, which in addition to fostering peer interactions should make students more comfortable sharing their work. After ~10 minutes in breakout rooms, the course staff will designate a representative from each room to quickly summarize their discussion for the rest of the class. Ultimately this should be a more efficient use of class time than reviewing each student’s work individually. 

Local Resources: A core tenet of the course is to emphasize to students that they are joining a global community of makers. Especially in a remote format, we encourage students to reach out to their local community Fab Labs or Makerspaces (sometimes hosted in schools, libraries or community centers). The course staff will help guide students to find relevant resources and send letters of introduction where appropriate. In addition to enhancing the student’s experience in the course, the hope is that this interaction will form a lasting bond and contribution to the student’s local community. For the Summer 2020 PHYS S-12 course, all 4 international students as well as several US-based students were able to make connections with their local Makerspaces, in some cases using their equipment to produce their assignments. 

It is widely recognized that the remote learning regime exacerbates differences in access to resources, giving an unfair advantage to those students who can afford costly computer equipment and have supportive and engaged family members at home. This trend is especially true for hands-on project-based classes such as this, where unequal access to materials/supplies as well as Makerspaces further compounds the divide. In light of this unfortunate situation, we consider it the student’s responsibility to provide an honest assessment of the resources available to them (including local Makerspaces). In turn, it is the teaching staff’s responsibility to evaluate and balance access to resources, using their best judgment to compensate less advantaged students by giving them priority when it comes to teaching staff time and access to lab equipment. For example, the teaching staff will prioritize providing design feedback, machine time on a 3D printer, and shipping for a student who does not have access to 3D printers, as opposed to a student who has access to a 3D printer at home or nearby.
 
Furthermore, we emphasize that purchasing additional components for assignments is the student’s prerogative, but will not enhance their grade -- one needs only the contents of the kit to earn an A in the course. We believe that we have done a reasonably good job of equalizing access to resources in the previous Spring and Summer courses and will continue to be particularly sensitive to this issue, especially in a remote teaching regime. -->
