		<h3> Description: </h3>
		<p> 	
			Make a website! You will use this website to turn in your assignments for the rest of the semester. You should use HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap techniques that we learned in class -- however, you will likely need to spend some time researching new techniques in order to customize your site. The goal for this week is to make the site functional, i.e., that you're able to use it to host your assignments in a way that others are able to find them. You can (and should) continue refining the design when you have free time over the semester. It's fine to look for Bootstrap templates as references, but you must write all code from scratch. The assignment is <b>due by this Thursday.</b> 
		</p>

		<h3> Requirements: </h3>
		<p> 	
			 Your website must at least include all of the following features:
			 <ul>
			 	<li>A header section in the form of a multiline comment, specifying the class name, your name, your email, assignment number and your choice of title</li>
			 	<li> An index.html page that contains links to weekly (assignment) pages </li>
			 	<li> Stand-in or "dummy" content for the weekly pages, which you will replace with your actual assignments as you go. It's not necessary to make a stand-in for each week yet, but the intention should be clear</li>
		 		<li> An "About" page, including a paragraph about your hobbies, interests, and why you're taking this course, as well as a photograph so we can more quickly learn each others' names</li>
				<!-- 		 		<li> Use of most of the following HTML tags: &lt;html>, &lt;head>, &lt;body>, &lt;h1>...&lt;h6>, &lt;p>, &lt;a>, <img>  -->
				<li> At least 3 different classes with attributes defined in a separate CSS file </li> 
				<!-- <li> Use Bootstrap for mobile-first responsiveness </li> -->
			</ul>
		</p>

		<h3> Examples: </h3> 
		<p>
		<a href='./github.html'>Example 1</a> <br>
		<a href='./github.html'>Example 2</a> <br>
		<a href='./github.html'>Example 3</a> <br>
		</p>
		<!-- <h3> Hacker Points: </h3>
		<p> 	
			  Complete your choice of the following features (or all) to get bonus points in the assignment:
			 <ul>
			 	<li>Add a navbar</li>
			 	<li> Add custom click or hover effects in CSS </li>
			 	<li> Use JavaScript to make responsive DOM elements </li>
			</ul>
		</p> -->

		<h3> Submission: </h3>
		<p> 	
			Use GitHub Desktop to commit and push your changes, and verify that they published to the web. We will be sharing and discussing our page designs next class.
