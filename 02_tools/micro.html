	<h3> What is a Microcontroller? </h3>
	<p> <!-- (From <a href='https://openlabpro.com/guide/basics-of-microcontroller/'> OpenLabPro </a>). --> Microcontrollers are small computers integrated in a single chip. They consist of memory (RAM and ROM), peripherals and a processor (CPU), as opposed to microprocessors which contain only a CPU. </p>

	<img src="./328p.jpg" alt="328p"> <br><br>
	
	<ul> 
		<li>Excellent for embedded applications </li> 
		<li>Low cost and low power consumption (ATMEGA328P ~ $1.5)</li> 
		<li>Can work up to tens of MHz as clock frequency</li> 
		<li>Standalone devices; most of them only need power and a clock source to run</li> 
	</ul>

	<p>Any gadget or equipment that does things like measuring, controlling, displaying and calculating values usually contains a microcontroller. They are present in: </p>

	<ul> 
		<li>Almost all contemporary home appliances </li>
		<li>Data acquisition or monitoring systems </li>  
		<li>Toys</li> 
		<li>Modern cars</li> 
		<li>Traffic lights</li> 
		<li>Smartphones</li> 
		<li>Office instruments</li> 
		<li>Satellites & space applications</li> 
	</ul>

	<p>You may have heard of some of the companies that make microcontrollers: </p>

	<ul> 
		<li>Microchip</li>
		<li>Atmel (now part of Microchip) </li>  
		<li>Intel</li> 
		<li>Analog Devices</li> 
	</ul>


	<h3> Parts of a Microcontroller </h3>

	<p> <img src="./architecture.jpg" alt="architecture"> <br><br>

		<ul> 
			<li> CPU: The most important part of a microcontroller is a central processing unit with a word length ranging from 4-bit to 64-bit. The central processing unit fetches, decodes and executes the instructions. It coordinates various activities taking place in the microcontroller.</li>

			<li> I/O ports: There are several parallel input/output ports in a microcontroller. They are used to interface various peripherals such as printers, external memories, LEDs and LCDs to the microcontroller. Apart from parallel ports, there are serial ports to interface serially connected peripherals with the microcontroller.</li>

			<li> Memory: Microcontrollers usually contain a certain amount of flash memory to store program source code as well as ROM (EEPROM) for permanent storage and RAM for temporary storage. </li>

			<li> Timers and counters: Timers and counters are used in operations which include modulation, clock functions, frequency generation and measuring and pulse generation.</li>

			<li> Analog to digital converters (ADCs): Such converters are useful while converting the output of a sensor which would be in analog form.</li>

			<li> Digital to analog converter (DAC): The working of a DAC is just the reverse of an analog to digital converter. As it is obvious, the output will be an analog signal which can be used to control the analog peripherals such a motor.</li>

		</ul>

	<h3> Power and Logic </h3>
	<p>Pulse Width Modulation (or PWM) is a technique for controlling power.  We also use it here to control the brightness of each of the LEDs. The diagram below shows the signal from one of the PWM pins on the Arduino.</p>

	<img src="./pwm.jpg" alt="pwm"> <br><br>

	<p> Roughly every 1/500 of a second, the PWM output will produce a pulse. The length of this pulse is controlled by the 'analogWrite' function. So 'analogWrite(0)' will not produce any pulse at all and 'analogWrite(255)' will produce a pulse that lasts all the way until the next pulse is due, so that the output is actually on all the time. </p>

	<p> If we specify a value in the analogWrite that is somewhere in between 0 and 255 then we will produce a pulse. If the output pulse is only high for 5% of the time then whatever we are driving will only receive 5% of full power. </p>

	<p> If however the output is at 5V for 90% of the time then the load will get 90% of the power delivered to it. We cannot see the LEDs turning on and off at that speed, so to us, it just looks like the brightness is changing </p>


	<h3> Memory </h3> 
<!-- 	RAM: Stands for random access memory; refers to memory that the microprocessor can read from and write to. When you create something in memory, it’s done in RAM.

ROM: Stands for read-only memory. The microprocessor can read from ROM, but it can’t write to it or modify it. ROM is permanent. Often, ROM chips contain special instructions for the computer — important stuff that never changes. The microprocessor can access information stored on a ROM chip whenever it needs to. The instructions are always there because they’re not erasable.

Flash memory: A special type of memory that works like both RAM and ROM. You can write information to flash memory, like you can with RAM, but that information isn’t erased when the power is off, like it is with ROM. Sadly, flash memory isn’t as fast as RAM, so don’t expect it to replace standard computer memory any time soon.
 -->
Flash memory:
Remembers data after power is turned off.
Slow read/write speeds compared to RAM/ROM
Can be manufactured in higher storage capacity than RAM/ROM
Used for SSDs, USB drives
RAM (Random Access Memory)
Loses data when powered off.
Fast read/write speeds
Relatively expensive to manufacture
Used for storing program memory while computer is running
ROM (Read Only Memory)
Does not lose data when powered off
Hard to write to
Speeds vary from very fast to flash memory speed
Usually used for storing the software to boot a computer/device nowadays.


	<h3> What is Arduino? </h3>
	<p> (From <a href='https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Introduction'> Arduino.cc </a>). Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online. You can tell your board what to do by sending a set of instructions to the microcontroller on the board. To do so you use the Arduino programming language (based on Wiring), and the Arduino Software (IDE), based on Processing.</p>

<!-- Why Arduino?
Thanks to its simple and accessible user experience, Arduino has been used in thousands of different projects and applications. The Arduino software is easy-to-use for beginners, yet flexible enough for advanced users. It runs on Mac, Windows, and Linux. Teachers and students use it to build low cost scientific instruments, to prove chemistry and physics principles, or to get started with programming and robotics. Designers and architects build interactive prototypes, musicians and artists use it for installations and to experiment with new musical instruments. Makers, of course, use it to build many of the projects exhibited at the Maker Faire, for example. Arduino is a key tool to learn new things. Anyone - children, hobbyists, artists, programmers - can start tinkering just following the step by step instructions of a kit, or sharing ideas online with other members of the Arduino community.

There are many other microcontrollers and microcontroller platforms available for physical computing. Parallax Basic Stamp, Netmedia's BX-24, Phidgets, MIT's Handyboard, and many others offer similar functionality. All of these tools take the messy details of microcontroller programming and wrap it up in an easy-to-use package. Arduino also simplifies the process of working with microcontrollers, but it offers some advantage for teachers, students, and interested amateurs over other systems:

Inexpensive - Arduino boards are relatively inexpensive compared to other microcontroller platforms. The least expensive version of the Arduino module can be assembled by hand, and even the pre-assembled Arduino modules cost less than $50
Cross-platform - The Arduino Software (IDE) runs on Windows, Macintosh OSX, and Linux operating systems. Most microcontroller systems are limited to Windows.
Simple, clear programming environment - The Arduino Software (IDE) is easy-to-use for beginners, yet flexible enough for advanced users to take advantage of as well. For teachers, it's conveniently based on the Processing programming environment, so students learning to program in that environment will be familiar with how the Arduino IDE works.
Open source and extensible software - The Arduino software is published as open source tools, available for extension by experienced programmers. The language can be expanded through C++ libraries, and people wanting to understand the technical details can make the leap from Arduino to the AVR C programming language on which it's based. Similarly, you can add AVR-C code directly into your Arduino programs if you want to.
Open source and extensible hardware - The plans of the Arduino boards are published under a Creative Commons license, so experienced circuit designers can make their own version of the module, extending it and improving it. Even relatively inexperienced users can build the breadboard version of the module in order to understand how it works and save money.
