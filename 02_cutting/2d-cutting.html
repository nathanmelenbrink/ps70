### Laser cutter

Laser cutting works by focusing the output of a high-power laser through optics at the material, which then either melts, burns, vaporizes away, or is blown away by a jet of gas. 

![laser diagram](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1d/LaserCutter.jpg)

[Laser types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_cutting)  

* Nd:YAG - The neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) laser uses a solid crystal substance to focus light onto its target. 
  * 1.06 micron wavelength - [optical reflectivity](Metal_reflectivity.png)
  * Does not work well on organic materials (wood, rubber, etc.), ideal for some metals and plastics
* CO2 - uses a gas medium instead of a crystal for focusing light
  * 10 micron wavelength 
  * Works well on wood, acrylic, plastic, and many other materials (especially > 100 Watt) 
* Fiber - solid state laser, increasingly popular especially for cutting metal
  * Solid gain medium, as opposed to a gas or liquid
  * Laser beam amplified with glass fiber 
  * Spot size up to 100 times smaller compared to CO2
  * No optics to adjust or align and no lamps to replace
  * Lower operational costs than CO2
  * [Jake's laser: Fablight - 1.5kW fiber laser](http://3dfablight.com/)
* [UV laser ablation](https://a-laser.com/uv-laser/) explodes material rather than melting it, which results in a sharper, cleaner edge and less thermal influence

Materials:

* Reflective metals like aluminum and stainless steel are best cut with fiber laser (smaller spot size). 
* Nervous System's [quest for perfect plywood for laser cutting](https://n-e-r-v-o-u-s.com/blog/?p=6042) (TL;DR -- contact small-scale manufacturer and specify your own grades, veneers, plys and glue)
* [The secret to clean laser cutting: Designing a better laser nozzle using 3D-printing](https://n-e-r-v-o-u-s.com/blog/?p=8722)

Lasers are also used for additive manufacturing processes like [selective laser sintering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_laser_sintering).

### Drag Knife Cutting

![drag knife](https://www.axyz.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/02/1080x440-banner.jpg)

_From [AXYZ](https://www.axyz.com/us/2019/02/26/drag-knives-for-cnc-routers-expand-creativity/), various CNC attachments for drag knife cutting._

* Various attachments exist for CNC machines to allow for drag knife cutting
* Other machines are built for this purpose (Zund, vinyl cutter)
* Some require special blades, others use common utility knife blades
* Spring force helps keep pressure constant 
* Rotary blade (wheel) vs. fixed blade 
* Drag knife cutting has been popularized via cheap "craft cutters" like [Silhouette](https://www.silhouetteamerica.com/) and [Cricut](https://hackaday.com/2021/03/15/cricut-decides-to-charge-rent-for-people-to-use-the-cutting-machines-they-already-own/). These suffer from restrictive firmware and obnoxious subscription fees. 
* Many DIY solutions to build drag knife cutters from [printers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZMQ3P8K2wE), [3D printers](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4441625), or [CNC routers](https://www.cnccookbook.com/build-drag-knife-cnc-router-mill/). 

#### Vinyl Cutting

A vinyl cutter is a type of computer-controlled machine that controls the movement of a sharp blade over the surface of the material. Applications: 

* Stickers and signage
* Heat transfer / apparel 
* Circuits

### Zund Cutter

Zund makes large-scale high-precision CNC systems that use a range of cutting tools. Most commonly, materials are cut with a knife blade that is actively rotated to follow the direction of the cut (therefore not a drag knife). This machine can be used to cut materials that are too toxic or flammable to cut with a laser. 
The GSD Fabrication Lab has [great documentation](https://wiki.dev.tlt.harvard.edu/confluence/display/fabricationlab/Zund+Cutter+Tutorial) for using their Zund cutter.

_Tool options for the Zund cutter (Credit: Rachel Vroman)_

* Universal Drawing Tool (UDT) - For drawing lines with a pen
* Universal Cutting Tool (UCT) - For most cutting operations
* Electric Oscillating Tool (EOT) - For soft materials such as cardboard, foamcore, or rubber
* Pneumatic Oscillating Tool (POT) - like EOT but with greater blade throw and faster oscillation for thicker materials.
* Driven Rotary Tool (DRT) - For fabrics and fabric-like materials.
* V-Cut Tool (VCT) - For cutting bevels and v-cuts in foam core less than 1/2". (Not Pictured Above)


### Ultrasonic Cutting

Piezoelectric transducers create high frequency (20-40 kHz), low amplitude (10-70 Âµm) vibrations that provide the energy to slice through an object with very little pressure.

### Die Cutting 

<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_cutting_(web)'>Die cutting</a> is the general process of using a die to shear webs of low-strength materials. 

* E.g. rubber, fibre, foil, cloth, paper, corrugated fibreboard, chipboard, paperboard, plastics, pressure-sensitive adhesive tapes, foam, and sheet metal.
* Started as a process of cutting leather for the shoe industry in the mid-19th century.
* Kiss cutting: cut through just one layer of a laminate, used on labels, stamps, and other stickers.
* Rotary die cutting is often done inline with printing. 
* Flatbed die cutting is slower than rotary die cutting, but the tools are cheaper. (Better for smaller production runs).

### Plasma cutting

* [Examples](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry4kohKGAfI)
* An electrical channel of superheated, electrically ionized gas (i.e. plasma) is created from the plasma cutter itself, through the work piece to be cut, completing a circuit via a grounding clamp. 
* A compressed gas (oxygen, air, inert and others depending on material being cut) is blown through a focused nozzle at high speed toward the work piece. 
* An electrical arc is formed within the gas, between an electrode in the gas nozzle and the work piece itself. 
* The electrical arc ionizes some of the gas, thereby creating an electrically conductive channel of plasma. 
* As electricity from the cutter torch travels down this plasma it delivers sufficient heat to melt through the work piece. 
* At the same time, much of the high velocity plasma and compressed gas blow the hot molten metal away, thereby cutting through the work piece.

![CNC plasma cut](HPR800-thick-metal-cut.jpg)

* Traditionally, plasma cutting was viewed as a messy and rough cut process, but improvements in control technology have tightened tolerances and made the process more precise and accessible. 0.012" accuracy is quoted from [Plasma cutting: Then and Now](https://www.thefabricator.com/article/plasmacutting/plasma-cutting-then-and-now)
* [Plasma cutting basics](http://www.lincolnelectric.com/en-gb/support/welding-how-to/Pages/plasma-cutting-basics-detail.aspx)
* Any conductive material can be cut with plasma. Steel, Aluminium, Copper, Brass, Titanium, etc.
* Precision plasma cutting is [commercially availiable](http://www.plasma-automation.com/Machinery/Plasma-Cutting/Elite-Precision-Plasma-Cutter.php) at [different scales](http://www.modernmachinerycompany.com/plasma-cutting-machines/cnc-precision-plasma-cutting-machines/)




### Oxy-acetelene

<img src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/Brennschneiden.svg/800px-Brennschneiden.svg.png' alt='oxy' width='400'>

_Operating principle of burn cutting (Image: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Brennschneiden.svg))_

* Uses fuel gases (or liquid fuels such as gasoline) and oxygen to weld or cut metals
* Very affordable, also very dangerous 
* Can use the same cylinders with different tips to cut, heat treat, or weld
* Not good for aluminum and other very highly conductive materials because it will just melt everything: <br> 
![comparison](PlasmaComparison.jpg)

* For mass production oxy-fuel is easy to parallelize: <br>

### Waterjet cutting

Waterjets cut with an extremely high-pressure jet of water, or a mixture of water and an abrasive substance (called garnet). Waterjet cutting is preferred especially for materials that are sensitive to high temperatures.
