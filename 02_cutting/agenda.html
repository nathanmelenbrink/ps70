### Tuesday: 

_Please make sure you're able to access Autodesk Fusion 360_

3:00: <a href='../../lab/cutting/universal.html' target="_self">Intro to Laser Cutting</a>,  <a href='https://makezine.com/2015/11/13/how-to-use-your-digital-calipers-7-tips/'>Measuring with calipers</a>. <br>
3:20: Laser demo / <a href='../../lab/cutting/sketch.html' target="_self"> Fusion 360 sketch tutorial. </a>

### Readings:

<a href='../../lab/cutting/2d-cutting.html' target="_self">Guide to 2D cutting</a>, <a href='../../lab/cutting/engraving.html' target="_self">Engraving</a>, and <a href='../../lab/cutting/vinyl_cutter.html' target="_self">Vinyl Cutter</a>. <a href='https://roberthart56.github.io/SCFAB/SC_lab/Tools/2D_design/Inkscape/index.html'>Inkscape and Gimp for 2D design.</a> <br>
<a href='http://mars1980.github.io/resources/making_things_move.pdf' >Making Things Move</a> chapters 1-3. Much of this should be quick to skim through as a refresher, but pay attention to concepts that may be new to you like "minimum constraint design". No need to do the exercises. <br>

Sparkfun: <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/what-is-electricity">What is electricity?</a>,  <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/what-is-a-circuit">What is a circuit?</a>,  <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/electric-power">Electric power</a>, <a href='https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-breadboard'>Breadboards</a>. </p>

### Thursday: 

3:00: Website review, discuss final project ideas <br>
3:30: <a href='../../lab/electronics/electronics.html' target="_self">Intro to electronics</a>, [TinkerCAD](https://www.tinkercad.com/circuits) for electronics simulations. <br>
3:45: Workshop: Materials needed: 

- Microcontroller
- Breadboard
- Wires and stripper
- Multimeter
- Resistors and potentiometer 
- One or more LEDs  

Complete the following: 

- Use a breadboard
- Build an LED circuit
- Use a multimeter to measure voltage 
- Find the current through the LED 
- Try adding a button or switch to interrupt the flow of current 
- Build a circuit with multiple LEDs 
- What happens when resistors are arranged in series? Parallel? 


### Labs:

Work on assignment. Make sure you've cut at least your first iteration during lab. Cut something with the <a href='../../lab/cutting/vinyl_cutter.html' target="_self">vinyl cutter</a>. 

### Assignment: 

- Create a press-fit construction kit that can be assembled in multiple ways, and accounts for lasercutter kerf. Expect to make multiple trips to the laser cutter, as pieces often won't fit together perfectly the first time. <br>
Examples: <a href="https://kassialove.github.io/PS70-assignments/week2.html"> Kassia's triangles</a>, <a href='https://tomkinsc.github.io/harvard-ps70/2020-02-11/'>Chris's pencil holder</a>, <a href="https://kian2attari.github.io/2020/02/01/week-2.html">Kian's Moose</a> 
- Work through a Fusion 360 tutorial, like <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVFYrBClkPc'>this </a> or <a href='https://help.autodesk.com/view/fusion360/ENU/courses/AP-GET-STARTED-OVERVIEW'>some of these</a> (or similar if you are using other software) and document what you produce. 
- Select at least 2 household objects or components from the lab (could be items you think you might include in your final project). Measure them using calipers, and model them in Fusion 360 (or other program). Create an assembly using these components, and document your work on your webpage. You may also incorporate items from other 3D model repositories like <a href='https://grabcad.com/library'>GrabCad</a>.
