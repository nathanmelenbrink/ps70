## Setting up ESP32 Huzzah

 First we need to configure Arduino IDE to work with the Huzzah. 

 - First, download and install the <a href='http://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers'> CP2104 USB Driver</a>. 
 - Next, add this to Perferences &gt; Additional Boards Manager URLs: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json`. 
 - Finally, under Tools &gt; Boards Manager, add the "esp32" boards package. Select Adafruit ESP32 Feather as your board and select the corresponding port. 

Note: the terms here can be confusing. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP32'>ESP32</a> refers to a series of low-cost, low-power system-on-a-chip microcontrollers with integrated Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Its precursor was the ESP8266 -- many tutorials will be compatible with both. <a href='https://www.adafruit.com/feather'>Feather</a> is a line of development boards from Adafruit. The <a href='https://www.adafruit.com/product/3405'>Huzzah32</a> is the specific Feather board that is built around the ESP32. 

## Setting up ESP32-CAM

RandomNerd has a great guide for [setting up ESP32-CAM](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-cam-video-streaming-face-recognition-arduino-ide/). It's worthwhile to follow this example all the way through. 

Note that ESP32s do not like WiFi features like 5GHz, two-factor authentication, etc. It's best to use networks with simple SSID and password credentials. In 102, we have a network called "MAKERSPACE" and password "12345678". 


## Disclaimers 

There are many idiosyncracies for the ESP32 boards. It's helpful to bookmark the [pinout reference](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-pinout-reference-gpios/).

- All devices must be connected to the same WiFi network 
- ADC2 pins cannot be used while using the WiFi library (most ESP32 projects). ADC 1 pins are okay - that's 32-39, which, for the adafruit Huzzah, includes 32=A7, 33=A9, 34=A2, 36=A4, 39=A3.
