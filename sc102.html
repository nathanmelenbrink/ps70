	### SC 102 Fabrication Lab
		
	The Science Center Fabrication Lab is a resource available to the Harvard community to support coursework, cross-disciplinary research and personal projects. Due to resource limitations, we are typically only able to offer shop training and access to current and former students in our digital fabrication courses (PS70: Intro to Digital Fabrication in the Spring, Summer and Fall). Students interested in learning to use the lab equipment are encouraged to enroll in the course. Untrained students may use the space only under staff supervision; see our lab calendar for staffing hours.

	The Fabrication Lab was created in 2013 as a resource in the Department of Physics, and has since grown to support the diverse fabrication needs of the College. We support projects from all corners of the community, including musicians building novel instruments, researchers developing lab automation devices, and artists experimenting with drawing machines.

	The lab offers access to equipment and training for fabrication skills including CNC machining, molding and casting, sensor fabrication, microcontroller programming, radio communication (internet of things) and 3D printing. 

	The Fabrication Lab is an inclusive environment that fosters self-directed learning and open collaboration. We host public events, open houses and project fairs. You can join our mailing list for events and occasional updates by sending a blank message to fabrication-lab-subscribe@lists.fas.harvard.edu.
