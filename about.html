		<h3> Course Description</h3>
		<p> This course is a hands-on introduction to rapid prototyping, integrating physics, engineering, design, computer science, and art. Students learn to safely use software and hardware to fabricate programmable projects in a collaborative environment. Tools and topics include shop safety, hand tools, laser cutter, 3D printer, computer-controlled milling, electronic circuit design, programmable microcontrollers, molding, and casting. Applications include personal fabrication, product prototyping, fine arts, and creation of scientific research tools. Biweekly class meetings consist of a discussion of the previous assignment, a short lecture on the next topic, and a hands-on training session for the accompanying assignment. The course culminates with an individual final project, integrating as many of the topics as possible. In addition to class meetings there are supervised lab times to work on assignments. Each student documents work on each biweekly topic in a personal website, thereby finishing the course with an online portfolio that not only illustrates their new skill sets, but also contributes to a collective repository of knowledge. Although no fabrication expertise is required, the open-ended nature of the course would make it valuable for students with any amount of prior experience.</p>

		<h3> Classes </h3>
		<p> Class will meet twice each week. The first meeting will consist of a discussion of the previous week’s assignment, with each student reporting on progress, followed by a short introduction to the current week’s topic and assignment. The second meeting may include a short lecture but will primarily focus on a hands-on training session for the accompanying assignment. Meetings may also include appearances by local experts and field trips. Students are expected to arrive on time and to be prepared to participate in class activities. During class, material will be presented using a combination of lecture and in-class activities, so preparation is essential.
		</p>

 		<h3> Lab Access </h3>
		<p>Lab access will be 24/7 once online lab safety training is complete. TFs will be available during flexibly scheduled lab times. For some topics, supervision will be needed as students learn to operate machines safely. For each lab session, students should take care to:  </p>

		<ul>
			<li> Wear lab safety glasses or goggles (if you do not have a pair, you can borrow one from the lab)</li>
			<li> Wear comfortable clothing and closed-toe and heel shoes</li>
			<li> Read through the relevant documentation and have a plan for using lab time wisely</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Assessment</h3>
		<p> Students will be assessed on the basis of website documentation (60%), the documentation and presentation of the final project (20%) and attendance and participation (20%). Only work that is documented on the personal page will be considered for grading.</p>

		<p><b>Documentation:</b> Thorough documentation on your personal page is required in order to earn full credit for assignments (60% of total grade). A well-documented assignment is one that provides sufficient information for someone else to fully recreate your project. At a minimum this requires photographs, screenshots, and a thorough written description of the steps taken, and may also require code snippets, movies, 3D models and/or links to outside resources. Here is an example of a <a href='http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.14/people/andrew_mao/week6/'>well-documented assignment</a>. Instructors will provide examples and precedents for each assignment. Documentation will be assessed throughout the semester, and instructors will provide mid-term feedback. </p>

		<p><b>Final Project:</b> Students are asked to present an idea for a final project at the start of the semester, which is expected to evolve over the duration of the course. Students will have weekly opportunities for advising on final project ideation. Final projects should integrate most of the skills covered over the semester, including at a minimum:</p>

		<ul>
			<li> 3D design and fabrication (either mold/cast, 3D print, lasercut, etc.)</li>
			<li> Electronics (input and output)</li>
			<li> Microcontroller programming</li>
		</ul>
