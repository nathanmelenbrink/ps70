		<h3> Course Description</h3>
		<p> A hands-on introduction to rapid prototyping, integrating physics and engineering, design, computer science and art. Students will learn to safely use software and hardware to fabricate programmable projects. Tools and topics will include electronic circuit design, 3D CAD, programmable microcontrollers, and wireless networking (Internet of Things). Additionally, students will learn operational principles for techniques such as laser cutting, 3D printing, and computer-controlled milling. Students will work with course staff to prepare their design files and remotely operate machines, after which the components will be mailed to them. Applications may include personal fabrication, product prototyping, fine arts and the creation of scientific research tools. The course will culminate with an individual final project, integrating as many of the topics as possible. Each student will document work on each weekly topic in a personal website, thereby finishing the course with an online portfolio that not only illustrates their new skill sets, but also contributes to a collective repository of knowledge that serves as a foundation for continued learning. </p>

		<h3> Course Notes </h3>
		<p> Attendance is mandatory since lab safety training will occur during class times. Class will meet twice each week. The first meeting will consist of a discussion of the previous week’s assignment, followed by a short introduction to the current week’s topic and assignment. The second meeting may include a short lecture but will primarily focus on a hands-on training session for the accompanying assignment. Meetings may also include appearances by guest presenters or experts on a particular topic. 
		</p>

		<h3> Recommended Prep</h3>
		<p> There are no formal prerequisites for this course. Students are expected to provide their own laptop computer (tablets and Chromebooks are not sufficient for some of the software required for this course, but workarounds may be available -- please contact course staff with concerns). </p>

		<h3> Related Sections </h3>
		<p> In addition to the twice-weekly lecture times, the course staff will be available for lab sections scheduled throughout the week. Students are required to attend at least one lab section per week to check in with course staff on their progress, and are otherwise free to attend as many additional sections as they like. </p>

 		<h3> Lab Access </h3>
		<p>Lab access will be 24/7 once lab safety training is complete. TFs will be available during flexibly scheduled lab times. For some topics, supervision will be needed as students learn to operate machines safely. For each lab session, students should take care to:  </p>

		<ul>
			<li> Wear lab safety glasses or goggles </li>
			<li> Wear comfortable clothing and closed-toe and heel shoes</li>
			<li> Read through the relevant documentation and have a plan for using lab time wisely</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Assessment</h3>
		<p> Students will be assessed on the basis of website documentation (60%), the documentation and presentation of the final project (20%) and attendance and participation (20%). Only work that is documented on the personal page will be considered for grading.</p>

		<p><b>Documentation:</b> Thorough documentation on your personal page is required in order to earn full credit for assignments (60% of total grade). A well-documented assignment is one that provides sufficient information for someone else to fully recreate your project. At a minimum this requires photographs, screenshots, and a thorough written description of the steps taken, and may also require code snippets, movies, 3D models and/or links to outside resources. Here is an example of a <a href='https://aspartate.github.io/personal_website/blog/week-6-stepperpot/'>well-documented assignment</a>. Instructors will provide examples and precedents for each assignment. Documentation will be assessed throughout the semester, and instructors will provide mid-term feedback. </p>

		<p><b>Final Project:</b> Students are asked to present an idea for a final project at the start of the semester, which is expected to evolve over the duration of the course. Students will have weekly opportunities for advising on final project ideation. Final projects should integrate most of the skills covered over the semester, including at a minimum:</p>

		<ul>
			<li> 3D design and fabrication (either mold/cast, 3D print, lasercut, etc.)</li>
			<li> Electronics (input and output)</li>
			<li> Microcontroller programming</li>
		</ul>
