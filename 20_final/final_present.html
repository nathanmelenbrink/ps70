## Final Presentations

PHYSCI 70 Final Presentations will be held in SC102 on <b>Thursday May 12th from 3-6pm</b>. Please feel free to invite friends and family. Refreshments will be provided.  

### Presentation Format 

We will share our work in a "project fair" format, where everyone will have one hour to stand by their station and present their work to anyone who comes by. 

- Please have your class website open on a laptop (or other display). Be ready to demo your final project as best you can. Also, include any weekly assignments that you're proud of, especially kinetic sculptures. 
- Your grade is mostly based on your documentation and scope of work, but also on your presentation, to a lesser extent. Certain anonymous guest critics will be among the crowd, and they will have the chance to tell the teaching staff who they thought had the most impressive projects and presentations. 
- In addition to being required for the class, project fairs are a great opportunity to meet people and find future opportunities. Don't be shy! 
- Take a few minutes to see the other projects in your group, but mostly stay by your station.
