		<h3> Assembling the Lasercut Parts </h3>
		
		<p> The lasercut parts, in combination with 3D printed parts included in the kit, can be used to create a range of different machines. </p>

		<img src='./kitmachines.png' alt='machine assembly'>

		<p> For example, an H-bot drawing machine (left) or two connected linear stages (right). The linear stage assembly on the right also makes use of 2 angle (L) brackets installed between each motor and the wood plate. One is used to anchor the assembly to the table (via orange clamp). The other connects one stage to the other. </p>

		<img src='./4.png' alt='machine assembly'>

		<p> Begin by separating the wooden parts. Attach 2 vertical beams to the horizontal piece that connects to the motor. Pre-flex flexures to increase compliance (make it easier to put together).	</p>

		<img src='./0.png' alt='machine assembly'>

		<p> Press a bearing into the 3D printed pulley. Insert bolt into hole on far end of the assembly.   	</p>


		<img src='./3.png' alt='machine assembly'>

		<p> Assembly the carriage with 4 bearings. Mount bearings vertically or horizontally depending on where loads on the machine will need to be countered. Insert 3D printed timing belt clip.	</p>	

		<img src='./2.png' alt='machine assembly'>

		<p> Cut timing belt to length. Assemble 3/4 of carriage around the long plate. 	</p>	

		<img src='./1.png' alt='machine assembly'>

		<p> Close timing belt loop by pressing into the 3D printed clip. Cover with the top long plate. Finally, install top plate of carriage.	</p>

		<h3> Troubleshooting </h3>

		<p> Once assembled, you should be able to move the carriage along the axis with a little force. If there seems to be too much friction, try reducing it with the following steps: </p>

		<ul> 
			<li> Is the 3D printed pulley rubbing against the wood? Make sure the M5 screw is tightened. I've also found that there is not room for a washer underneath the bearing. </li> 
			<li> Are the internal hex nuts (the four nuts that each tighten a bearing against the wood) rubbing against the wood channel? You may need to rotate them (up to +/- 30 degrees) so that there is enough clearance. </li> 
			<li> In general, we've found that placing the bearings on the larger faces (i.e., opposite of what is shown in the preceding images) results in smoother motion. </li> 
			<li> Look down the length of the timing belt loop. Is the timing belt straight? You may need to raise or lower the aluminum pulley to make the timing belt as straight as possible.  </li> 

		</ul>
